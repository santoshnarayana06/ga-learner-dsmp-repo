## Problem Statement

Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. Success of an app is largely determined by its ratings.

But is there any particular pattern among high rated apps? Does size or genre of the app play a role in determining its high rating?

Conduct an EDA on the Google Play Store data and try to explore whether given the data, ratings of an can be predicted.

The dataset has details of 10841 apps with following 13 features

    Feature -Description

    App - Name of the app

    Category -Category the app broadly belongs to

    Rating -Customer rating of the app

    Size -Size of the app

    Installs -Number of Installs done for the app

    Type -Type of the app(Free/Paid)

    Price -Price of the app(if any)

    Content Rating -What age group is the app appropriate for

    Genre -What all genres the app belongs to

    Last Updated -Date on which the app was last updated

    Current Ver -Version of the app

    Android Ver -Android Version required by the device to the run the app



### Learnings from the project

 Learnings from the project

After completing this project, I now have a better understanding of certain methods of EDA and Data Preprocessing.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Approach taken to solve the problem

    Data Loading
    Removal of rows having rating more than 5
    Null Value Treatment
    Correlation between Rating vs Category
    Correlation between Installs vs Ratings
    Correlation between Price vs Ratings
    Correlation between Genres vs Ratings ( splitting genres and keeping only one genre per app in case of multiple genres)
    Correlation between Last Updated vs Ratings
